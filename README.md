# BookProject
*Idea: Bulk review checking for books*
These days, everyone wants to read reviews before commiting to something. But it's a **pain** to have to individually google several things in a row

1. User takes a photo of a bookshelf
2. App identifies books and text
3. App queries for books 
4. Display results

### Currently:
Consumes Google Books API, processing several queries, each representing a book as a list of Strings.
Returns matching book results

#### Setup: 
Create API_KEY.txt file in parent dir, with Google API Key
